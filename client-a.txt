# Client Task A #
# Add your pseudocode to this file below this line: #
# ------------------------------------------------- #

1-The user enters the range's bottom and upper bounds.

2-For future use, the compiler creates a random integer between the range and stores it in a variable.

3-We'll initialize a while loop for repeated guesses.

4-The user receives the message "Try Again! "if they guess a number that is higher than a randomly chosen number. You made an incorrect estimate.

5-The user receives the message "Try Again! "if their guess is less than a randomly chosen number. You made a small guess.

6-Additionally, the user receives a "Congratulations!" output if they made the required amount of guesses.

7-Otherwise, the user will receive "Better Luck" if they are unable to estimate the integer in the allotted number of tries.
